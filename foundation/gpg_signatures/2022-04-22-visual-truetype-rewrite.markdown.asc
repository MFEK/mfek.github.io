## Rationale

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, OpenType fonts are the main type of font used in computing today;

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, despite the increasing acceptance of high DPI screens, such screens have not totally overtaken the market as was once predicted;

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, even high DPI screens still require hinting for best display;

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, TrueType hinting remains the best way to hint OpenType fonts in the sense that it gives the most control to the font developer;

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, Microsoft developed in the 1990's a programming language known as VTTTalk;

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, VTTTalk instructions are written as UTF-8 into the OpenType font table marked <tt>TSI3</tt>;

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, Microsoft has open sourced the compiler which converts VTTTalk into TrueType instructions;

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, despite this act, however generous it may be on the surface, Microsoft refuses to provide to the community a way of generating VTTTalk instructions (the VTT GUI);

<span class="whereas">Whereas</span>, the Modular Font Editor K Foundation, Inc., opposes in principle the necessity of proprietary software to create fonts in open file formats,

<span class="whereas">Then, therefore</span>, The Modular Font Editor K Foundation, Inc. opens for bids from the public the following signed <strong><em>grant proposal</em></strong> dated this 22<sup>nd</sup> of April, 2022, entitled “{{page.title}}” and with the reference code <em>{{page.refcode}}</em>.

The Foundation estimates this grant will take two months to complete.

This is document revision {{page.rev}}.

## Bottom bid
The Foundation's bottom bid for this grant is US$7,000. The Foundation may reject bids above this bottom bid, but also may not, especially if good reasons are given for the higher bid (e.g. our time estimate is wrong). The Foundation proposes a payment schedule of 2x$3,500.

## How to bid
The <a href="/foundation/terms.html">Standard Terms</a> apply to this invitation. That page also explains how to bid, please read it if interested.

## Work description

The more we can create free software that does the same job as Visual TrueType, the better. However, the minimum required is:

<ol>
<li>creation of a graphical program that can create the needed <tt>TSI*</tt> tables based on the glyphs in a UFO font, covering all of the code generation tasks that VTT itself can do, <em>unless</em><dl><dd>one or more of the code generation tasks done by VTT you are able to demonstrate to us is very difficult to achieve and would take much longer than we predict</dd></dl></li>
<li>while we prefer the final product use Rust and GTK, <em>we are willing to waive this in this exceptional circumstance because Visual TrueType and TT hinting is such a skilled area</em>. Bidders, please state your preferred language/GUI toolkit if it will not be Rust and GTK. We of course remain totally unable to accept proprietary languages and toolkits.</li>
<li>your work product will be checked against the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/VisualTrueType">Microsoft Visual TrueType command line compiler</a>.</li>
</ol>
