Thank you for your interest in bidding on a grant offered by the MFEK Foundation, Inc.

The Modular Font Editor K Foundation, Inc. accepts bids from any software developer worldwide with whom it can legally contract (must be above the age of 18, must not be from e.g. North Korea, etc.). Payment can be arranged via SWIFT bank transfer, US domestic ACH (the “Automated Clearing House”), mailed check, CashApp, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Monero. **No PayPal, ever.**

Bids may be declined for any or no reason, even if they meet our minimum, at the sole discretion of the Foundation's chairman as advised by the Foundation's Board. The Foundation is more likely to reject your bid if it thinks you have no relevant experience, so please include information about your experience in your bid.

All of our grants have an expected time to completion and a payout schedule. This is flexible. If you demonstrate the problem to be harder than we thought, it is possible that we will agree to pay you more than you bid, once again, at our discretion.

If a grant goes one month without any bids, the grant may be reissued under the same number. The price may or may not be increased. Typically we do not revoke grants unless the Board (in practice, the chairman himself) plans to do the work, and will leave the grant open for as long as it takes to get a bid.

If it is particularly difficult to fill a bid, we may hire a project manager to go on freelancing websites to try to fill the bid — or the chairman might do that himself. So please bid early. We will consider a bid filled this way as just as legitimate as any other bid.

We may also advertise our bid invitations. Typically, the longer it takes to fill, the more we will advertise.

All of our grants that have invitations to bid attached include a list of features that the software must have for the Foundation to consider the grant complete. Please email if there is any confusion.

While we work to set up email service for this domain, please send bids to [copypaste@kittens.ph](mailto:"Fredrick Brennan" <copypaste@kittens.ph>?subject=[MFEK bid] Bid on № X of YYYY). Please at least attach a description of your relevant experience, your bid total, your full legal name, your country of residence, a corporate identity if you wish us to pay one, your preferred method of communication among this list: email; Twitter; and Discord, and the method by which you wish to be paid.
